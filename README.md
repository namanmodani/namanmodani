### Hi, I'm Naman.

I'm passionate about shaping and shipping meaningful products.

I spend most of my time learning. I'm curious about most things (I'm glad I'm not a cat), especially engineering, product, and finance. A big chunk of this learning happens at UCLA.

Lately, I've been focused on spending my time intentionally. I like to leap off cliffs, camp, and drive. I dance (badly), listen to old music, play poker, and watch sports.
