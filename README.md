### Hi, I'm Naman.

I'm a junior at UCLA studying computer science and tech management.

I enjoy engineering, product, and finance. This past summer, I was a Technical PM at [Slack](https://slack.com/) in the Bay, where I managed vision and delivery of some exciting data engineering tools.

When I'm not working, I like to jump off cliffs, camp, drive, dance, and listen to classic rock. I also make horrible puns from time to time.
