### Hi, I'm Naman.

I'm an undegraduate at UCLA studying computer science and math.

I teach the underprivileged at [Sandhi](https://sandhi-the-connect.github.io/) and explore machine learning at [ACM AI](https://www.uclaacm.com/). When I'm not doing either, I usually end up playing chess or reading about technology or finance.

I spent this past summer back home, where I built some exciting tech at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en) and travelled.
