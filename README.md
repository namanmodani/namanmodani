### Hi, I'm Naman.

I'm an undergraduate at UCLA studying computer science.

I teach the underprivileged at [Sandhi](https://sandhi-the-connect.github.io/) and explore machine learning at [ACM AI](https://www.uclaacm.com/). In my spare time, I play chess or read about tech, product, or finance.

I spent this past summer as a Technical PM at [Slack](https://slack.com/) in the Bay, where I delivered some very exciting tech and travelled.
