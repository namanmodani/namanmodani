### Hi, I'm Naman.

I'm an undergraduate at UCLA studying computer science and tech management.

I teach the underprivileged at [Sandhi](https://sandhi-the-connect.github.io/) and explore machine learning at [ACM AI](https://www.uclaacm.com/). This past summer, I was a Technical PM at [Slack](https://slack.com/) in the Bay, where I managed the delivery of some exciting tech.

When I'm not working, I like to jump off cliffs, camp, drive, dance, and make horrible puns.
