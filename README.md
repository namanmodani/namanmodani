### Hi, I'm Naman.

I'm a sophomore at UCLA studying computer science and math.

I teach the underprivileged at [Sandhi](https://sandhi-the-connect.github.io/) and explore machine learning at [ACM AI](https://www.uclaacm.com/). When I'm not doing either, I usually end up playing chess or reading about technology or finance.

This summer I'm headed back to India, where I'll be building tech for social good at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/company-facts/ericsson-worldwide/india) and travelling.
