### Hi there, I'm Naman ðŸ‘‹

I love solving problems. Throughout my educational career, I've been driven by my intellectual curiosity to find innovative solutions to pressing problems. Whether it's [providing quality education to the underprivileged](https://sandhi-the-connect.github.io/) or [leveraging ML to predict rare diseases](https://denotia.herokuapp.com/), I've been able to quickly uncover pain points and identify strategic solutions.

Currently, I'm seizing incredible opportunities with an insanely gifted group of people at the AI divison of the [Association of Computing Machinery](https://www.uclaacm.com/) at UCLA. I'm a lifelong learner obsessed with all things technology - so if you ever want to bounce ideas off of me, shoot me a message!
